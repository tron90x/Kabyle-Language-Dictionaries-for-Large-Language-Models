Instructions for Using a Kabyle-French Dictionary

Introduction

Kabyle is a Berber language with complex grammar. Dictionary words are given in their base form (masculine singular for nouns), but they change according to grammatical context. Here are the essential rules for recognizing and using these variations.


1. Noun Structure

Base Form

Masculine nouns generally start with a-: axxam (house), argaz (man), afus (hand)

Feminine nouns generally start with ta- and end with -t: taddart (village), taqcict (girl)

2. Noun Gender

Feminine Formation

From a masculine in a-, the feminine is formed with ta-...-t:


axxam → taxxamt (house)

aqcic → taqcict (boy → girl)

amcic → tamcict (cat → female cat)

Exceptions

Some nouns have an irregular feminine or no direct correspondence.


3. Number (Plural)

Plural in Kabyle can be:


External Plural (Regular)

Masculine: i-...-en or i-...-anaxxam → ixaamen (houses)

argaz → irgazen (men)

Feminine: ti-...-intaxxamt → tixxamin

taqcict → tiqcicin

Internal Plural (Irregular)

The word changes internally:


afus → ifassen (hands)

awal → awalen (words)

4. Construct State (Changes According to Prepositions)

This is the most important rule! Nouns change form after certain prepositions.


Free State (Base Form)

Used after: d (it is), yellan (who is), as subject


Axxam ameqqran (a big house)

Construct State - "u-" Form

After prepositions: seg (from/since), deg (in), ɣer (towards), n (of/genitive)


axxam → uxxamExample: deg uxxam (in the house)

Example: seg uxxam (from the house)

Construct State - "w-" Form

After: d (and/with), s (with/by means of), am (like)


axxam → wuxxam or wexxam Example: d wuxxam (with the house)

Example: s wuxxam (by means of the house)

For Feminines

The construct state removes the initial t-:


taddart → teddart (after seg, deg, etc.)

taxxamt → texxamt

5. Common Phonetic Transformations

Vowel Assimilation

a + prefix → can become e, i depending on context

axxam → ixxamen (plural) → ixemmisen (diminutive)

Geminated Consonants

Some consonants can be doubled or geminated (written with double letter):


amellal (white) → timlellin (white, feminine plural)

6. Articles and Demonstratives

Kabyle has no definite/indefinite article like French, but uses:


-a (suffix) for "this": axxam-a (this house here)

-nni or -nna for "that": axxam-nni (that house there)

7. Possession

Possession uses n (of) + construct state:


axxam n urgaz (the house of the man)

afus n tqcict (the hand of the girl → n teqcict)

8. Dictionary Search Rules

How to Find the Base Word

If the word starts with i-...en/an → look for a-...

irgazen → look for argaz

If the word starts with ti-...in → look for ta-...-t

tiqcicin → look for taqcict

If the word starts with u- → look for a-...

uxxam → look for axxam

If the word starts with w- → look for a-...

wuxxam → look for axxam

For a feminine without initial t → add t- at the beginning

teddart → look for taddart

9. Verbs (Basic Overview)

Verbs also have very varied forms according to tense, aspect, and subject. Base form often in the aorist:


ruḥ (to leave) → yruḥ (he left) → itruḥu (he leaves habitually)

kker (to get up) → yekker (he got up)

10. Negative Particles

ur ... ara frame the verb for negation

Example: ur iruḥ ara (he did not leave)

Final Note

Kabyle grammar is rich and complex. These rules cover the most common transformations, but there are exceptions and special cases. When in doubt, prioritize searching for the simplest form of the word (masculine singular) in the dictionary.
